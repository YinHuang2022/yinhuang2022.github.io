My ultimate goal is to employ artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary research as tools to shape a better world. For that, I have delved into the transportation domain as the use case. [The essence of transportation is to reconcile the spatio-temporal imbalance in the distribution of matter, information and energy, which is all about time and space](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-autonomous-driving-transportation-science-fiction-yongqi-dong/?trackingId=7Vv1ACfy%2Ftudg0Q5UUXfFA%3D%3D). Thus, I had attached the utmost importance to the spatial-temporal correlations in my research.

My current research centres around three main pillars, i.e., <br/>
1) **Deep Learning for sensing and anomaly detecting**,<br/>
2) **Deep Reinforcement Learning for controlling and decision-making**,<br/>
3) **Big Data Analytics for spatial-temporal pattern mining**.<br/>

## Deep Learning for Sensing and Anomaly Detecting
**Sensing---Lane Detection as the Case Study**
- **_Objective_**: To develop robust spatial-temporal neural network models to tackle lane detection in challenging scenes
- **_Delivery_**: **Three** research papers, **one patent**, and **one software registration**

* **A Hybrid Spatial-temporal Deep Learning Architecture for Lane Detection** ([Published in CACIE](https://doi.org/10.1111/mice.12829))
