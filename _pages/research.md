My ultimate goal is to employ artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary research as tools to shape a better world. For that, I have delved into the transportation domain as the use case. The essence of transportation is to reconcile the spatio-temporal imbalance in the distribution of matter, information and energy, which is all about time and space. Thus, I had attached the utmost importance to the spatial-temporal correlations in my research.

My current research centres around three main pillars, i.e., <br/>
1) **Deep learning-based time series prediction and spatiotemporal anomaly detection**,<br/>
2) **Big Data Analytics for urban mobility pattern mining**,<br/>
3) **Deep reinforcement learning-based control and optimization.;**.<br/>
