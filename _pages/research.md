My research interests are centered on harnessing artificial intelligence methodologies to address complex spatiotemporal challenges in modern transportation systems, with a vision to advance operational intelligence in the era of big data. At the intersection of computational science and urban mobility, my work primarily focuses on three pillars: <br/>
