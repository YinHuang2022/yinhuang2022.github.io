I am Huang Yin, a Master's candidate at Southwest Jiaotong University pursuing a degree in Safety Science and Engineering. Based at the [National Engineering Laboratory for Comprehensive Transportation Big Data Application Technology](https://ctt.swjtu.edu.cn/yethan/WebIndexAction?setAction=common&sid=79FADCFD4573759D), my research focuses on AI-powered spatiotemporal transportation data mining, including:  

  -  Multimodal transportation data fusion and mining  
  -  Mobile spatiotemporal pattern analysis  
  -  Transport & Traffic Safety  
  -  Data-driven transportation facility safety management  
  -  Deep Learning/Deep Reinforcement Learning applications in transport services (prediction, classification, anomaly detection, optimization)  
<mark style="background-color: SpringGreen">I am seeking research assistant positions (2025-2026) followed by Ph.D. opportunities (Spring or Fall 2026 intake). </mark>I welcome discussions about aligning my work with your research group's vision for intelligent transportation systems.


Biography
======
Since September 2022, I have been pursuing my Master's degree at the [School of Transportation and Logistics, Southwest Jiaotong University](https://ctt.swjtu.edu.cn/yethan/WebIndexAction), specializing in data-driven transportation facility safety management. My thesis project, "<span style="color:blue">__Fault Warning of Hydraulic System of Railway Tamping Vehicle Based on Deep Learning_</span>" [Thesis to be released], originated from an industry-academia collaboration with [Shenhua Railway Equipment Company](http://www.shenhuachina.com/). This work investigates sensor deployment strategies and multi-source sensing data applications for health management and fault diagnosis in railway maintenance machinery (including ballast cleaning machines, tamping vehicles, and stabilizers).

During 2022-2024, **I acquired expertise in AI technologies including deep learning and deep reinforcement learning**, achieving proficiency in Python libraries (numpy, pandas, torch, torch_geometric). I successfully replicated time-series models such as **Transformer, Informer, Autoformer, DLinear, and PatchTST**, and conducted research on parking demand prediction under multimodal transportation data fusion scenarios.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Transportation Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2022. From 2021-2022, I participated in the National Engineering Laboratory's research project "<span style="color:blue">_**Construction of Chengdu's Comprehensive Transportation Data Governance System**_</span>". This initiative aimed to enhance data application scenarios through systematic data processing architecture development, supporting Chengdu's smart transportation and sustainable urban development. Through this experience, I mastered various transportation data structures (subway, bus, taxi, ride-hailing, bike-sharing), data processing workflows, and transportation-geospatial visualization techniques.
